# MVP

This MVP has to prove that our idea can be applied in the future. Therefore, we have to prove the adopted concepts. If possible with real tests on a reduced scale.

## Definitions

- Use API modules developed in Python (FastAPI) to facilitate integration.
	1. SMSClient.py: sends sms to client informing them of delivery within one hour. Asks if she/he is at home, customer answer: y or n. If the client answers something other than yes (y) or not (n) it sends another message saying that the format is just y or n.
	2. CallClient.py: 15 minutes before delivery, call the customer and ask if he can receive the order, answer y or n. In the future identify the client response with nlp.
	3. coordinates.py: with an address returns the coordinates (lat and long).
	4. closestLocker.py: with the coordinates, it returns the closest available locker (you have to evaluate the size of the order).
	5. boxMeasurement.py: Using the luxonis camera, take the measurements of the box. Using the luxonis camera, take the measurements of the box. This will be done at the warehouse.
- Develop a frontend with a table of deliveries and status. Clicking on the delivery opens its details.
	+ Javascript?
- Develop a map to simulate locations / deliveries / lockers?
	+ Lets do this?
