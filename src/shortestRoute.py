Find the shortest route based on two nodes (start and end).

Usage:
    shortest_route(G, start_lat, start_long, end_lat, end_long)

Example:
    # find the best route between two client1 (40.2019077, -8.4132559) and client2 (40.2079321, 8.4241537)
    route1 = shortest_route(G, 40.2019077, -8.4132559, 40.2079321, 8.4241537)
